## Introduction
PaperSpot is a personal project aimed at providing a free, open, and easy way to facilitate access to academic research. With PaperSpot, you can search for scholarly papers using keywords and read them directly through the platform. It integrates seamlessly with free online libraries such as arXiv, Papers with Code, and HAL, allowing you to explore a wide range of scientific literature. Whether you are a researcher, student, or simply someone interested in academic studies, PaperSpot offers a comprehensive and user-friendly interface to discover and read papers from trusted sources.

## Disclaimer

PaperSpot works perfectly with arXiv papers. However, be careful with Papers with Code papers because the application uses stars on repositories as citations. Therefore, they are always classified as "more relevant" than others. As for HAL, at the current stage of the app, there is no citation information available, so the number of citations is set to 0 by default.
